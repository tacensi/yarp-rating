yarp-rating
===========

This is just an attempt to create a WP rating plugin. Not working yet. More explanations below.

### What?
Yarp stands for Yet Another Rating Plugin. I am pretty aware that there are many rating plugins for WordPress, such as [WP-PostRatings](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-postratings/), by [Lester GamerZ Chan](http://profiles.wordpress.org/GamerZ/), and [GD Star Rating](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gd-star-rating/), by [GDragon](http://profiles.wordpress.org/GDragoN/), among many others. But while some don't support user editing or updating their rating, like WP-PostRating, other are well too bloated with functionalities I don't want, like GD Star Rating.

So this is my attempt to create a simple rating plugin that allow users to vote and later edit their votes. Initially, only registered users will be allowed to vote in a 5 star system (and I probably will keep it that way, for obvious reasons). But as of yet, it is not working, as stated above.

## When?
I don't really know.

## Who?
Well, I am not really a developer, but I will try hard with the help of Brad Williams, Ozh Richard and Justin Tadlock, with their excellent publication [Professional WordPress Plugin Development](http://justintadlock.com/plugindevbook), by Wrox Press.
